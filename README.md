Project is an assignment from The Odin Project, and it will test my skills of CSS and Objects in JavaScript. <br>
[23.04.21] First commit / polishing the css layout and index html page. 

[25.04.21] I wrote the logic in javascript, not going to lie - a lot of it was highly influenced from the tutorial<br>
